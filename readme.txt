== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this do? =

It displays your public gists from GitHub on the sidebar, linking to each of them on GitHub.

= They look kind of bland. Can I style them? =

Sure can. There are four classes to look at to add to you CSS.

* Each list item `<li>` has the class `gist_item`
	
* Each link within the `<li>` has the class `gist_link`
	
* The optional creation date is wrapped in a `<span>` with the class `gist_date`

* The optional link to your GitHub profile is in a `<p>` with the class `github_link`


= Is that it? =

Pretty much, yeah.
